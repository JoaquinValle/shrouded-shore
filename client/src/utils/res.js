        '<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This game is a forerunner of many &quot;dice&quot; games and the game younger children play today which is known as <em><a  href="/boardgame/15393/jacks"   >Jacks</a></em>. The game was &quot;old&quot; by the time it was played in Ancient Rome, since it had been played in Greece and other parts of the ancient world before it found its way to Rome. The game has many counterparts throughout the Middle East and Asia. Some historians indicate that the game may have had its origins in some religious rite, while others believe the game was always just a gambling game.</p>\n\n<p><em>Knucklebones</em> are the dried ankle bones of sheep. They have 4 different sides - one flat, one concave, one convex, and one sinuous side. Values were assigned to each side. In ancient times, adults as well as children played <em>Knucklebones</em>.

        '  Background:  \n\n This game is a forerunner of many "dice" games and the game younger children play today which is known as   Jacks  . The game was "old" by the time it was played in Ancient Rome, since it had been played in Greece and other parts of the ancient world before it found its way to Rome. The game has many counterparts throughout the Middle East and Asia. Some historians indicate that the game may have had its origins in some religious rite, while others believe the game was always just a gambling game. \n\n  Knucklebones  are the dried ankle bones of sheep.
